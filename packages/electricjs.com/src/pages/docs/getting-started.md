## Yeoman Generator

The [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/Robert-Frampton/generator-metal-ssg) is
the fastest way to get a `metal-ssg` project up and running.

Install dependencies.

```
npm i -g gulp yo
```

Install generator.

```
npm i -g genrator-metal-ssg
```

Run the generator with `yo metal-ssg` in the command line. This will prompt you
for a project id and name, then it creates a folder in your current
directory with your new `metal-ssg` project.

## Project Dependencies

All dependencies are adding automatically when using the Yeoman Generator, but
when creating a project from scratch, the following dependencies must be added
to the project.

```
npm i --save gulp metal-ssg
```

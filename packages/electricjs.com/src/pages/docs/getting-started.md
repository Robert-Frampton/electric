## Yeoman Generator

The [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/liferay/generator-electric) is
the fastest way to get an `electric` project up and running.

Install dependencies.

```
npm i -g gulp yo
```

Install generator.

```
npm i -g generator-electric
```

Run the generator with `yo electric` in the command line. This will prompt you
for a project id and name, then it creates a folder in your current
directory with your new `electric` project.

Having issues getting the generator running? Check
out [Yeoman's FAQs](http://yeoman.io/learning/faq.html) for troubleshooting
tips.

## Project Dependencies

All dependencies are adding automatically when using the Yeoman Generator, but
when creating a project from scratch, the following dependencies must be added
to the project.

```
npm i --save gulp electric
```
